# Steam Account Swticher
Swtich Steam accounts **super fast** on **Windows**. **No software needed**! Only Scripts!

## How to setup
### Step 1: Download the scripts
Click the big green button says code. (If you can't find the button go to this website first: https://github.com/logeeker/Steam-Account-Swticher) 

Click Download ZIP.

Uncompress the zip file to a location you want (such as your desktop)

### Step 2: Getting your AccountName
The first thing you need to to write down or remember your **AccountName** from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\loginusers.vdf (path may vary if you didn't install Steam using the default path). You can open the vdf file using a text editor of your choice (such as notepad).
### Step 3: Setting up .reg files
Open any **one** of the .reg files. Replace the **YOUR_AccountName** with **one of** your AccountName you found from the loginusers.vdf file mentioned above.

**Repeat** above steps with **another AccountName** on the other .reg file.

If you have **more than 2 accounts**, just duplicate any of the .reg files and repeat the steps. Note: **the file name of the .reg file doesn't matter**. 
## How to use
Using it is **super simple**. 

Just double click to **run the .reg file** you want to switch to. Click yes all the way through.

Double click to run the **killsteam.bat** file.

Start Steam again.

Note: The order of the steps doesn't really matter. You can run the killsteam.bat file first then the .reg file. As long as you run killsteam.bat before restarting steam you are all good.
